      <h2 id="who-are-we">Who are we?</h2>

<p>We are a community that loves to make, learn and have fun.</p>

<p>To become a member have a look <a href="/join/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We have very few hard and fast rules, instead we prefer to encourage creativity and collaboration through guiding principles. Please see below.</p>

<h2 id="our-guiding-principles">Our Guiding Principles</h2>

<p><strong>Safety:</strong> We make awesome tools accessible to members and the public at times. This means that members hold a lot of responsibility both for themselves and for others wellbeings.</p>

<p><strong>Non Exclusivity:</strong> We encourage members to use the space to run events, they must be open to anyone that is interested and cannot be charged for - knowledge is free.</p>

<p><strong>Consensus Protocol:</strong> Disagreement is inevitable, it is important for us however to have discussions and make decisions with by doing what is best for the group as a whole. The voice of the few are equal to the voice of the many - we do not govern by mob rule.</p>

<p><strong>Creativity Encouraged:</strong> All members are permitted to make changes to the space, create new areas and explore new things. We call this the “6 hour rule”, if what you do can be undone in 6 hours then no permission is necessary. If longer then consult others and get further opinions.</p>

<p>Please check out our <a href="https://github.com/HakLand/Constitution">constitution</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Below are a few other things to be mindful of, again covered in the constitution linked above.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary Accomodation :</strong> Hackland is not the place for emergency accomodation. No one should be spending the night or sleeping in the space. This may change in the future by method of consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial use and prototyping:</strong> A hackspace is a great place to try ideas, prototype first versions and maybe even bootstrap a business - but doing the actual manufacturing there puts strain on other members.</p>

<p><strong>Donation of Things &amp; Materials:</strong> We welcome donations! Things can either be loaned to the space or gifted to the space. Please note however that space is at a premium, if donated items take up a large amount of space or are not in the interests of the community a discussion should be had before accepting them.</p>
