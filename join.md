Members can use the space whenever they want, 24 hours every day of the week.

The hackspace is regularly open to the public whenever a member is in to open up, and weekly on Thursday from 6pm - this is the busiest time and the best for new people visiting.

Membership costs $20 a week but please pay as much as you feel is fair so the space can survive.

Membership includes full access to everything 24/7* including:

+ UNLIMITED Fibre Internet
+ Access to all of the tools
+ A Storage Box for projects
+ A quiet place to work (sometimes quiet)
+ All of the tea / coffee

Other Things to note:

+ No powertools/noisey things after 10pm
+ We have recycling, rubbish and compost bins to use, please dispose of things properly. These services are for everyone to use, so if you want to dispose of large quantities please consider taking them to the [refuse centre](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/rubbish-recycling/Pages/transfer-stations.aspx).
+ Please have a read [here](/about/) for more information around how Hackland operates day to day.

We **don't accept** members for **one-off time-critical project** (eg: holiday van build) - there are commercial workshops you can rent for this purpose elsewhere, eg: The Warren, Gribblehurst Community Shed.
