Members can use the space whenever they want, 24 hours every day of the week.

The hackspace is regularly open to the public whenever a member is in to open up, and weekly on Thursday from 6pm - this is the busiest time and the best for new people visiting.

Membership costs $20 a week but please pay as much as you feel is fair so the space can survive.

Membership includes full access to everything 24/7* including:

+ UNLIMITED Fibre Internet
+ Access to all of the tools
+ Storage for projects
+ A quiet place to work (sometimes quiet)
+ All of the tea / coffee

*plz no powertools/noisey things after 10pm

We **don't accept** members for **one-off time-critical project** (eg: holiday van build) - there are commercial workshops you can rent for this purpose elsewhere, eg: The Warren, Gribblehurst Community Shed.
